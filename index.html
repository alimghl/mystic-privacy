    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong>  October 25, 2025</p>

    <p>Mystic Insighter ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Mystic-Advisor and Mystic Insighter mobile applications (collectively, the "Service").</p>
    
    <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

        <li><strong>Chat Data:</strong> The primary function of our Service is to facilitate chat between users of the Mystic Insighter (client) app and the Mystic-Advisor (advisor) app. We collect and store the content of these messages, which may include text and media (images, videos) that you send.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Log and Device Data:</strong> We may collect information that your device sends, such as your device's IP address, device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.</li>

        <li>To provide customer support.</li>
        <li>To monitor the usage of our Service and improve it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
    <p>Your information, including chat messages and personal data, is stored on secure servers. We use third-party services like **Firebase** for database, authentication, and cloud storage.</p>
    
    <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties except in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate the core chat function between a client (Mystic Insighter) and an advisor (Mystic-Advisor).</li>
        <li>To comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        <li>To protect the security of the Service and our users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our applications may request certain permissions to function. We only request permissions necessary for the app's features.</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Photo/Media Library (Storage):</strong> We request this permission to allow you to select existing photos or media from your device to upload for your profile picture or to send in chat messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We use commercially acceptable means (such as encryption and services like Firebase) to protect your Personal Data, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
