    <h1>InSoul Platform Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 15, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the entire InSoul ecosystem, which includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mystic Insighter</strong> (Client Application)</li>
        <li><strong>InSoul Expert</strong> (Expert/Advisor Application)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We ("we," "us," or "our") operate these mobile applications (collectively, the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We collect different types of information to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>

    <h3>A. Information All Users Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we collect personal identifiers such as your name, email address, and username.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication Data:</strong> The primary function of our Service is to facilitate consultations. We collect and securely store chat messages, including text, images, and audio notes sent between Clients and Experts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Specific Information for Experts (InSoul Expert App)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Verification Data:</strong> To ensure the quality of our platform, we may collect professional details, certifications, or identification documents from Advisors/Experts for verification purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> We track earnings and consultation history to facilitate payouts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> We may collect information your device sends, such as IP address, device type, operating system version (e.g., Android or iOS), and unique device identifiers to assist with crash reporting and app functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service (e.g., delivering real-time messages and notifications).</li>
        <li>To verify the identity and qualifications of Experts on the InSoul Expert app.</li>
        <li>To provide customer support and troubleshoot technical issues.</li>
        <li>To monitor usage trends to improve user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
    <p>Your information is stored on secure servers using <strong>Google Firebase</strong> for authentication, database, and cloud storage.</p>
    
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We only share information in the following strictly limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> Necessary data (like messages or profile names) is shared between the Client and the Expert involved in a specific consultation.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> If required by law or to protect the safety of our users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. App Permissions (Android & iOS)</h2>
    <p>Our applications request specific permissions to enable core features. You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings, though some features (like video consultations) may stop working.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera (<code>android.permission.CAMERA</code>):</strong>
            <br><em>Purpose:</em> Used to allow Experts and Clients to take profile photos, send images in chat, and conduct real-time video consultations. Video calls are transmitted in real-time and are not permanently recorded by us unless explicitly stated.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Microphone / Audio (<code>android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO</code>):</strong>
            <br><em>Purpose:</em> Required for voice notes and the audio portion of video/voice consultations.

            <br><em>Purpose:</em> Used to allow you to upload existing photos (such as screenshots or profile images) from your gallery.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us. We use industry-standard encryption (SSL/TLS) during data transmission and rely on secure infrastructure provided by Google Firebase. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not directed to anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child without parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
